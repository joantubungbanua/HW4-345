** REST API Homework ** 
** by Joan Tubungbanua **


Through this assignment, I was able to figure out the right endpoints in order to successfuly 
1) list branches
2) create a new repo
3) creating an issue 
4) edit a repo to enable wiki support 

It was honestly really cool to be able to do this in the comfort of my command line for I have never done it before.
