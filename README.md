**REST API Homework** 
**by Joan Tubungbanua**


Through this assignment, I was able to figure out the right endpoints in order to successfuly 
1) list branches
2) create a new repo
3) creating an issue 
4) edit a repo to enable wiki support 

It was honestly really cool to be able to do this in the comfort of my command line for I have never done it before. 

In the second part of the assignment, I had to run the code for the REST Server and successfuly run all of the commands.
